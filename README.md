# A-Frame Tournament

## Overview

A-Frame Tournament is an A-Frame-based First-Person Shooter (FPS) game inspired by Unreal Tournament. The game aims to deliver a fast-paced, action-packed multiplayer experience in WebXR. Utilizing the A-Frame framework for building WebXR experiences and the `aframe-physics-system` for realistic physics interactions, A-Frame Tournament offers basic player controls, shooting mechanics, enemy AI, and jumping capabilities.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently in the very early stages of development. The initial setup and core mechanics are being implemented, and many features are yet to be added. Contributions and feedback are welcome as the project evolves.

## Current Features

### Player Controls

- **WASD Controls:** The player can move around using the W, A, S, and D keys.
- **Look Controls:** The player can look around using the mouse.
- **Jump:** The player can jump by pressing the spacebar.

### Shooting Mechanics

- **Shooting:** The player can shoot bullets by clicking the mouse.
- **Bullet Physics:** Bullets are fired with realistic physics interactions.

### Enemy AI

- **Movement:** Enemies move towards the player.
- **Health:** Enemies have health points and can be damaged by bullets.
- **Death:** Enemies change color and stop moving when their health reaches zero.

### Physics

- **Player Physics:** The player entity interacts with the environment using physics.
- **Bullet Physics:** Bullets have realistic physics properties.
- **Enemy Physics:** Enemies interact with the environment using physics.
- **Environment Physics:** The floor and other static elements use physics for collision detection.
